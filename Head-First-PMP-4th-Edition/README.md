### Chapter 1: Introduction
* **Knowledge**, **performance**, and **personal skills** are the three areas that project managers focus on to get better at their jobs
* A **project charter** is a document that describes a project's requirements and high-level schedule, assigns a project manager, and authorizes the project.
* A **program** is a collection of projects that should be managed together in order to achieve a specific goal or benefit to the company.
* A **portfolio** is a collection of projects or programs.
* A **project** gathers a team together to do work that's **temporary**, creates a **unique result**, and is **progressively elaborated**.
* An **operation** (or **process**) is work that's done in a way that's repeatable and ongoing, but is not a project.

### Chapter 2: The organizational environment
* Functional managers have all the power in a functional organization. Project managers have the power in a projectized organization.
* If a question on the exam doesn't state an organization type, assume it's referring to a matrix organization. That means the PM is responsible for making budgets, assigning tasks to resources, and resolving conflicts.
* Project coordinators and expediters don't exist in a projectized organization.
* A project expediter keeps track of project status only. A project coordinator has some authority, and usually reports to someone higher up in the company. Neither role has as much power or authority as a real project manager, even though expediters or coordinators may have "Project Manager" printed on their business cards.

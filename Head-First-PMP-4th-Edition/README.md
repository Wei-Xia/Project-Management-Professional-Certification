### Bullet Points: aiming for the exam
* **Knowledge**, **performance**, and **personal skills** are the three areas that project managers focus on to get better at their jobs
* A **project charter** is a document that describes a project's requirements and high-level schedule, assigns a project manager, and authorizes the project.
* A **program** is a collection of projects that should be managed together in order to achieve a specific goal or benefit to the company.
* A **portfolio** is a collection of projects or programs.
* A **project** gathers a team together to do work that's **temporary**, creates a **unique result**, and is **progressively elaborated**.
* An **operation** (or **process**) is work that's done in a way that's repeatable and ongoing, but is not a project.

## Chapter 2: Organizations, constraints, and projects
### Organization Magnets
#### Functional organization
* PMs spend half their time doing admin tasks.
* Project managers need to clear major decisions with department managers.
* Pms don't set the budget.
### Projectized organization
* Teams are organized around projects.
* Project managers choose the team members, and release them when the project is over.
* Project managers estimate and tract budget and schedule.

### Types of organizational structures
#### Organic organization
* Project management is handled as a part-time responsibility for someone on a project team.
* Project managers are usually contributors to the project who take on the added responsibility of helping stakeholders understand project status.
* In an organic organization, it's likely that the project manager has little responsibility for budget decisions. Usually those kinds of decisions are made by the company owner.
#### Functional organization
* Project management decisions need to be cleared with functional managers.
* Project managers are the functional managers in getting the work done.
* Project managers spend lots of time doing administrative tasks and often work as PMs only part of the time.
* You're likely to find project expediters in functional organizations.
#### Multidivisional organization
* PMs might operate in a completely different way from division to division.
* PMs are often project coordinators or part-time  expediters who actually work on the project team as a full-time contributor but take on the added responsibility of communicating project status.
* Decisions about budget or resource allocation need to be made by functional managers.
#### Weak matrix organization
* PMs have some authority, but they aren't in charge of the resources on a project.
* Major decisions still need to be made with the functional manager's cooperation or approval.
* Project expediters and project coordinators can work in weak matrix organizations, too.
#### Balanced matrix organization
* Project managers share authority with the functional managers.
* PMs run their people-management decisions by the functional manager, but the functional manager runs project decisions by the PM, too.
#### Strong matrix organization
* Project managers have more authority than functional managers, but the team still reports to both managers.
* The team might be judged based on performance on their projects, as well as on their functional expertise. In a strong matrix, delivery of the project is most important.
#### Project-oriented organization
* Teams are organized around projects. When a project is done, the team is released, and the team members move on to another project.
* The project manager makes all of the decisions about a project's budget, schedule, quality, and resources.
* The PM is responsible for the success or failure of the project.
#### Virtual organization
* Virtual teams can be made up of people from many different parts of an organization who might have different reporting structures and work in different offices.
* Project managers often take on the role of facilitating team communications on virtual teams.
* PMs in this organizational structure sometimes have authority over budget and resource allocations.
#### Hybrid organization
* Hybrid organizations put together practices for working in predictive lifecycles with practices for working in adaptive ones.
* Predictive lifecycles tend to rely more on management for understanding scope and status, while adaptive ones make that data transparent and focus on self-management within each other.
* Since the teams are using a combination of practices, the way the project manager works varies along with the team.

### Manage project constraints
* Time
* Cost
* Scope
* Resources
* Quality
* Risk

### Organizational process assets
* Process
* Policies
* Knowledge repositories
* Procedures

### Enterprise environmental factors
* People
* Market
* Databases
* Risk tolerance
* Standards

### Bullet Points: aiming for the exam
* Functional managers have all the power in a functional organization. Project managers have the power in a projectized organization.
* If a question on the exam doesn't state an organization type, assume it's referring to a matrix organization. That means the PM is responsible for making budgets, assigning tasks to resources, and resolving conflicts.
* Project coordinators and expediters don't exist in a projectized organization.
* A project expediter keeps track of project status only. A project coordinator has some authority, and usually reports to someone higher up in the company. Neither role has as much power or authority as a real project manager, even though expediters or coordinators may have "Project Manager" printed on their business cards.
